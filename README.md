## Credits
The source code for this application, namely the client-server folders along with the code-mirror setup and execution were all done by the EDX-Bootcamp out of the Extended University of Wisconsin Campus! It was great getting to see this in action! Also, WebpackHTML documentation alongside WebpackPWAManifest documentation were absolutely vital for this project.
